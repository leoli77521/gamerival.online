                <h2>Game Features</h2>
                <p><strong>🧟‍♂️ Endless Zombie Hordes:</strong> Face increasingly difficult waves of zombies with different abilities, speeds, and strengths as you progress.</p>
                
                <p><strong>🏗️ Base Building:</strong> Construct walls, traps, and defensive structures to protect yourself from the undead masses that never stop coming.</p>
                
                <p><strong>🔫 Arsenal of Weapons:</strong> Collect and upgrade firearms, melee weapons, and explosives to effectively eliminate different types of zombies.</p>
                
                <p><strong>🎒 Resource Management:</strong> Scavenge for food, ammunition, medical supplies, and building materials while managing limited inventory space.</p>
                
                <h2>How to Play</h2>
                <p><strong>Movement:</strong> Use WASD or arrow keys to move around the map. Hold Shift to run, but watch your stamina as running attracts more attention.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Combat:</strong> Left click to attack with your current weapon. Right click for secondary attacks or to aim down sights with firearms.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Building:</strong> Access the building menu to construct defenses during calm periods. Plan your layout carefully for maximum effectiveness.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Scavenging:</strong> Search abandoned buildings, cars, and bodies for useful items. Different locations yield different types of resources.</p>
                
                <h2>Zombie Types</h2>
                <p><strong>🚶‍♂️ Walker:</strong> Standard zombies that move slowly but in large numbers. Easy to kill individually but dangerous in groups.</p>
                
                <p><strong>🏃‍♂️ Runner:</strong> Fast-moving zombies that can quickly close distances. Harder to hit but have lower health than other types.</p>
                
                <p><strong>💪 Brute:</strong> Large, heavily armored zombies with massive health pools. Require heavy weapons or explosives to eliminate effectively.</p>
                
                <p><strong>🤢 Spitter:</strong> Ranged zombies that attack from a distance with acid projectiles. Prioritize eliminating them to avoid constant damage.</p>
                
                <h2>Weapon Categories</h2>
                <p><strong>🔫 Firearms:</strong> Pistols, rifles, and shotguns provide excellent damage but require ammunition management and attract zombie attention.</p>
                
                <p><strong>⚔️ Melee Weapons:</strong> Knives, bats, and axes for silent kills. No ammo required but put you at risk in close combat.</p>
                
                <p><strong>💥 Explosives:</strong> Grenades and bombs for clearing large groups. Limited supply but extremely effective against hordes.</p>
                
                <p><strong>🏹 Ranged Tools:</strong> Crossbows and throwing weapons offer silent ranged attacks with reusable ammunition.</p>
                
                <h2>Survival Strategies</h2>
                <p><strong>🏠 Secure a Base:</strong> Find a defensible location and fortify it early. Having a safe retreat point is essential for long-term survival.</p>
                
                <p><strong>🔇 Noise Management:</strong> Gunfire and running attract zombies. Balance the need for speed and combat with stealth when possible.</p>
                
                <p><strong>📦 Resource Prioritization:</strong> Food and medical supplies are crucial for survival. Don't hoard items you can't use immediately.</p>
                
                <p><strong>⏰ Day/Night Cycle:</strong> Use daylight hours for scavenging and building. Nights are more dangerous but offer better loot in some areas.</p>
                
                <h2>Building System</h2>
                <p><strong>🧱 Walls:</strong> Basic defensive structures that slow down or stop zombie advances. Upgrade to stronger materials as you progress.</p>
                
                <p><strong>⚡ Traps:</strong> Automated defenses like spike pits and electric fences that damage zombies without requiring your attention.</p>
                
                <p><strong>🚪 Doors & Gates:</strong> Controlled access points that allow you to enter and exit your base while keeping zombies out.</p>
                
                <p><strong>🔋 Power Systems:</strong> Generators and solar panels to power electric traps and lighting systems for nighttime defense.</p>
                
                <h2>Resource Types</h2>
                <p><strong>🍖 Food:</strong> Essential for maintaining health and stamina. Canned goods last longer than fresh food but are harder to find.</p>
                
                <p><strong>💊 Medicine:</strong> Bandages, antibiotics, and painkillers for treating injuries and illnesses caused by zombie encounters.</p>
                
                <p><strong>🔧 Materials:</strong> Wood, metal, and concrete for building and upgrading defensive structures around your base.</p>
                
                <p><strong>🔋 Fuel:</strong> Gasoline and batteries needed to power vehicles, generators, and electronic equipment.</p>
                
                <h2>Pro Survival Tips</h2>
                <p><strong>🎯 Headshots Count:</strong> Aim for the head to eliminate zombies more efficiently and conserve ammunition for longer survival.</p>
                
                <p><strong>🏃‍♂️ Hit and Run:</strong> Don't get surrounded. Create escape routes and use mobility to avoid being overwhelmed by hordes.</p>
                
                <p><strong>🔄 Upgrade Progression:</strong> Focus on upgrading one weapon type rather than spreading resources across multiple weapon categories.</p>
                
                <p><strong>🗺️ Map Knowledge:</strong> Learn spawn points, loot locations, and safe routes to maximize efficiency and minimize risk.</p>
                
                <h2>Technical Specifications</h2>
                <p><strong>Platform:</strong> Web Browser (HTML5)</p>
