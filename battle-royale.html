                <h2>Game Features</h2>
                <p><strong>🏟️ Massive Arena:</strong> Battle across a large, detailed map with diverse environments including cities, forests, mountains, and industrial zones.</p>
                
                <p><strong>⚔️ Multiplayer Combat:</strong> Compete against real players in intense firefights using strategy, skill, and quick reflexes to outlast your opponents.</p>
                
                <p><strong>🎒 Loot System:</strong> Scavenge for weapons, armor, medical supplies, and equipment scattered throughout the battlefield to improve your chances.</p>
                
                <p><strong>⭕ Shrinking Zone:</strong> Stay inside the safe zone as it continuously shrinks, forcing players into closer combat and ensuring matches don't last forever.</p>
                
                <h2>How to Play</h2>
                <p><strong>Landing:</strong> Choose your landing spot carefully. High-loot areas are dangerous but rewarding, while remote areas are safer but have less equipment.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Looting:</strong> Search buildings and areas for weapons, ammunition, armor, and healing items. Better equipment gives you advantages in combat.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Zone Management:</strong> Always be aware of the safe zone and plan your movement accordingly. Getting caught outside means taking damage over time.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Combat:</strong> Use cover, aim carefully, and manage your resources. Third-person perspective allows you to peek around corners safely.</p>

                <p><strong>💥 Shotguns:</strong> Devastating close-range weapons that can eliminate enemies in one or two shots. Extremely limited range.</p>

                <h2>Survival Strategies</h2>
                <p><strong>🗺️ Map Knowledge:</strong> Learn the map layout, high-loot zones, and common player routes. Knowledge is power in battle royale.</p>

                <h2>Game Modes</h2>

                <p><strong>🔄 Inventory Management:</strong> Keep your inventory organized and drop unnecessary items to make room for better equipment.</p>
                
                <p><strong>🌊 Zone Edge Strategy:</strong> Sometimes staying near the zone edge can protect your back while you focus on enemies ahead.</p>
                
                <p><strong>🎪 Final Circle:</strong> In the final circles, every move matters. Be patient, use cover effectively, and wait for opportunities.</p>
